# pages

Pages adds a menu named "Pages" to Google Docs to do page-specific operations.

## Duplicate until first page break

**Duplicate until first page break** will copy the text up to and including the first page break, and paste it after that first page break.

This is useful if you have a long standup document which needs daily copy-and-pasting, and you're too lazy to use the clipboard manually.
